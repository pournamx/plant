# [The Leaf That Knows] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Member
- Member: [Pournami Hari Lakshmi] - [LBS Institude of Technology for Women]

### Project Description
"Talk to the Partially Dead Plant" is a strange, interactive widget featuring a dead houseplant (or cactus, or eucalyptus ‚Äî you choose). No matter how much you water it or what you ask, it remains beautifully lifeless.
Each question you ask is met with a one-time, weirdly poetic (and slightly unsettling) response from the plant ‚Äî and then silence

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- Help you grow real plants üå±

- Answer seriously

- Serve any actual purpose

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Because sometimes, all you need is a partially dead plant that talks back once ‚Äî and never again.
